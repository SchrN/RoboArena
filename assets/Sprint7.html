        <b>Visual Changes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Buttons significantly bigger.</li>
            <li>Buttons have rounded edges.</li>
            <li>Hovering over a button changes the color.</li>
            <li>Different Font.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Stylesheet in Qt Designer</b>

        <ul>
            <li>The stylesheet influences the appearance and behaviour of the buttons.</li>
            <li>The process of changing the buttons is much easier and more practical in Qt Designer compared to directly modifying the code of the buttons in our python files.</li>
            <li>We wanted to use a custom font, but QT Designer doesn't enable adding custom fonts.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img src="Sprint7/stylesheet.JPG"><br><br>

        <b>Switching between menus(windows)</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Changed the way how we switch between windows.</li>
    <li>Using the setCentralWidget function is more practical and prevents the small flickering we had previous when switching between menus.</li>
    <li>We dont have to adjust the position everytime we open a new window.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Starting the game from the menu</b>
    <ul>
    <li>The game is startable from the menu by setting the CentralWidget to the Arena class.</li>
    <li>Currently the robots arent loaded.</li>
    <li>Switching between the menu and the actual game window is without delay.</li>
    </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Extending the config file </span></strong> <br><br>


    <ul>
    <li>Added several variables.</li>
    <li>The different python  files obtain their information from the config file.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="Sprint7/config_file.JPG"><br><br>
        
    <b>Advantage:</b>
        <ul>
    <li>We can change properties of the game just by changing variables in the config file and dont have to search for every instance in different py files.</li>
        </ul>
    <b>Code to access config file</b> <br><br>
    <img src="Sprint7/config_code.JPG"><br><br>
    <ul>
    <li>An instance of the Configparser Class is created.</li>
    <li>The config file is read.</li>
    <li>Variables from different Sections are saved.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Adding sounds to the main game </span></strong> <br><br>

    <b>Background music</b> <br><br>

    <ul>
    <li>To play background music, we create an instance of the MusicPlayer Class, introduced in previous sprints and call the play function.</li>
    <li>Its the same way how we play music in the menu windows.</li>
    </ul>
            
    <b>Game sounds(weapons)</b> <br><br>
    <ul>
    <li>In the keyPressEvent function, when the shoot button is pressed, in this case it is f, the respective sound is played.</li>
    <li>Additionally we want to play sound effects when a player gets hit by a projectile.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="Collision-Experiment">
            <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Changing Collision (Tom)</span></strong> <br><br>

            We thought it would be a good idea to rework the way our collision system works. Currently whenever you hit a wall, you must turn away from it to be able to drive again. We planned on having the robots "drift" on the wall
            whenever you drive into them in an angle. However with our current Robots, which can only drive forwards, this would recquire a major rework, for which we do not have the time this late in the project. Instead we decided on automatically
            turning the robots automatically to simulate this behaviour:<br><br>

            <source src="Sprint7/WallCollisionTurn.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <br><br>
        </video> <br><br>

        Code for this behaviour:<br>
        <img src = "Sprint7/dynmanicCollDect2.png"><br><br>

        However when testing this in-game it did not feel good as it took control away from the player whenever they hit a wall. It did also not fit our more slow paced gameplay. Thus we decided to remove this again.

     <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Drawing Robot classes and robot ownership (Tom)</span></strong> <br><br>
     Since we added different classes to our Game we need a way to distinguish them while playing.<br>
     We drew these using Inkscape:<br>
     <br> These will be mostly used in the menu for Class-Selction

     Icon for the Velocity Robot class:<br>

     </div>

     <div class="Drawing robots in game">
     In-game players not only need to be able to tell apart different robot classes and also the robots from each Player 1 and Player 2.
     To accomplish this we draw the Robot of Player 1 red and the Robot of Player 2 blue.

     At first we tried to simply drew the circles for the robots as we had previously done using the appropriate Player Color and then draw the corresponding triangle pattern on top of it. However we also need to rotate it correctly for the player to be able to tell
     which direction he is facing. This sadly did not work as the pivot point for the rotation of the Pattern seems to be off centered. We exported the pattern at different resolutions, tried with different images and tried moving
     the pivot point however the rotation was always wobly and did not work.<br>

     In order to circumvent this we now draw the Player ellipse and instead display the class icon above each robot. This ended up looking pretty clean in the end anyway so we stopped investigating solutions to our first approach.<br>
     <img src="Sprint7/RobotsIconsAbove.png"><br><br>

     And this is the code we use to draw it:<br>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Player2 and Projectils (Marcel)</span></strong> <br><br>

    At first i added the controls for Player2:<br>
    <img src="Sprint7/Player2Control.png"><br>

    After that i added the Projectile Weapons. For Performance i did not want to creat new objects so i stored the data in the weapon class:<br>

    The Class also handles the movment of the Projectile:<br>
