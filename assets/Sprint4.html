<li>In-game UI to show cooldown and health of robots</li>
<li>Including sound effects and music</li>

    <b> The menus </b> <br>
    
    <img src="Sprint4/mainmenu.JPG"> <br><br>
    <b> Main menu</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The first menu the player sees, when starting the game.</li>
        <li>The player can choose between advancing to the play menu, the settings menu or closing the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    
    <img src="Sprint4/playmenu.JPG"> <br><br>
    <b> Play menu</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The player can choose between game modes or go back to the main menu.</li>
        <li>Enabling multiplayer is a stretch goal, the button could be deleted in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br><br>
        
    
    <img src="Sprint4/settingsmenu.JPG">  <br><br>
    <b> Settings menu</b> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The player should be able to change the volume of the sound, which is not yet implemented, in the settings menu.</li>
        <li>1 possible stretch goal would be, to allow the player to change key bindings.
        <li>The graphics button will be likely deleted in the future, for our game, it is difficult to give the player options to change the appearance of the game.</li>
    </ul>
        
        <br><br>
        

    <b>Qt Designer</b> <br>
    We worked with Qt Designer to create Ui-files which can be loaded through the loadui()function. <br>
    Working with Qt Designer is way more comfortable than trying to create the UI with grid based layouts, since we can choose the positions of the buttons directly. <br>
    
    <img src="Sprint4/gtdesigner.jpeg" > <br><br>
    
    <b>Problem: </b> <br>
    The images we included in Qt Designer didnt show up when we executed the python code. <br>
    Therefore we add the images manually in the code. <br><br>
    
    
    <b> The class MainMenu </b> <br>
    
    <img src="Sprint4/classmainmenu.JPG"> <br>

    <ul>
    <li>MainMenu inherits from QMainWindow.</li>
    <li>We load the background-image with load.image.</li>
    <li>The UI, created previously with Qt Designer is displayed in the foreground by using the loadUi() function. </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <b> The functions, responsible for changing the menus </b> <br>
    
    <img src="Sprint4/clickedfunctions.JPG"> <br><br>
    
    An instance of the menu we want to visit is created and gets displayed.<br>
    Afterwards the old menu is closed.<br><br>
    
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Improving map editor:</span></strong> <br><br>

    <b>Implemented an undo function</b>
    <ul>
    <li>All made drawings are saved in the shapes array</li>
    <li>When the undo function is called, the latest included drawing is removed.</li> 
    <li>Afterwards the screen gets updated</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="Sprint4/undo.jpg"> <br><br>
    

    <b>Implemented a new function</b> <br>
    Added a new function, to revert the screen to its inital stage and delete all made drawings.<br>
    <ul>
    <li>When the new function is called, the shapes with all drawings is emptied.</li>
    <li>The result is, that the mapeditor screen is brought back to its initial stage.</li>    
    </ul>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Collision Detection(Tom):</span></strong> <br>
Implementing collision detection turned out to be a little more challenging than I thought. <br>
In the solution I ended up with I basically iterate over every tile the robots plans to move across. <br>
If we encounter any solid tiles within the radius of the robot, we stop moving at the last position at which there were no solid tiles within the robots radius.
<br>

Code for collision detection: <br>

A robot hitting a wall and only being able to go away from it: <br>

Added some type Hints:<br>

<br>                                 
Player Controls:<br>
First I added the PlayerControl as an enum so we can say which Robot we want to control for now just one.<br>
Next I wanted to get the Player Inputs a Problem was that KeyEvent only Returns one Pressed Key<br>
also it does not automatically keep track of the Keys we keep Pressing.<br>
My solution was to use Key Press- and Release- Events and write the Keys in a dictionary:<br>
<img src="Sprint4/GettingInputs.png"><br>
We keep track of all Pressed Keys so we can easily add new Player Controls.<br>
<br>
The MovementManager calls a function that than uses the inputs:<br>
